    /*
     * This is the example of fat locking.
     *
     * If VM detects contention on thread, it needs to delegate the
     * access arbitrage to OS. That involves associating the object
     * with the native lock, i.e. "inflating" the lock.
     *
     * In this example, we need to simulate the contention, this is
     * why we have the additional thread. You can see the fresh object
     * has the default mark word, the object before the lock was already
     * acquired by the auxiliary thread, and when the lock was finally
     * acquired by main thread, it had been inflated. The inflation stays
     * there after the lock is released. You can also see the lock is
     * "deflated" after the GC (the lock cleanup proceeds in safepoints,
     * actually).
